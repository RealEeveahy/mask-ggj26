  - "Why couldn\u2019t I do this right?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
  - I had been working on this my whole life!
  - "Maybe those voices were right, I shouldn\u2019t have bothered."
  - "It should\u2019ve gone to somebody who could do the job of court jester correctly."
  - "Instead of wasting everyone\u2019s time on my mediocrity, it could\u2019ve been
    spent been entertained by someone worth their time."
  - Unless it was someone to mock.
  - To point and laugh at.
  - Although I got lucky and was just sent on my way home.
  - "They could\u2019ve set me up in a pillory, in the town square, and have me humiliated
    for what I did."
  - So, I did the next best thing.
  - I locked myself away from the world.
  - "That way I wouldn\u2019t ever get in anyone\u2019s way."
  - There was nothing out there that I could do right anyway.
  - Even if there was I was too ashamed to ever show my face again.
  - How could I after those horrendous performances I did.
  - No matter how much my parents pounded on my door.
  - No matter how they pleaded and begged for me to come out.
  - There was no point if all I did was bring shame and embarrassment to those around
    me.
