  - Out of the hundreds that lined the halls, I was the one that was chosen.
  - Somehow, out of everyone that auditioned to become the new court jester, I was
    the one that the King and Queen decided on.
  - It was the best news that could ever happen!
  - Now I could have a steady source of income.
  - "I could help bring food to the table, and my family wouldn\u2019t have to worry
    about living on the streets."
  - While some may consider working, and owning, a bakery might seem like a luxurious
    job.
  - But my family is barely able to scrape by.
  - Ingredients were sometimes hard to come by, or expensive.
  - And with living near the outskirts of the kingdom, we had to sell our goods at
    a lower price.
  - So having this job, in the castle of all places, was something like a dream come
    true!
  - Besides I had plenty of practice putting on a performance.
  - "Or a \u201Cmask\u201D so to speak!"
