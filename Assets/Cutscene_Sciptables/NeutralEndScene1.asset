  - While I was descent at my job, the King and Queen soon grew tired of me.
  - They replaced, and discarded, me without a second thought.
  - "I had saved up some of the money I had received while working at the castle,
    but it wouldn\u2019t last forever."
  - My family and I had to go back to living in a house near the outskirts of the
    kingdom.
  - My parents continued to run the bakery, and I helped wherever I could.
  - During that time, I had found someone to settle down with.
  - "They were loving, and caring, even if I couldn\u2019t live up to their expiations."
  - Once my parents were old enough to retire, I took over the family business.
  - It only felt right to do so, and I had my partner by my side to help me through
    it.
  - Through all of this we eventually had kids of our own.
  - Our little family never moved from this little part of the kingdom.
  - We watched the world around us continue to change and move on.
  - The son of the King and Queen would take over who, soon after, was betrothed
    to the daughter of royalty status.
  - It was rumoured that this marriage was put in place to keep the peace between
    our kingdom and the neighbouring one.
  - "While a life might\u2019ve seemed mediocre in the eyes of those who lived in
    the castle, it was one we were contempt with."
  - This was the part we were meant to play.
  - Everyone had their place in the world, and this one was ours.
