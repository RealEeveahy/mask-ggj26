  - After the party word soon spread of my work as a court jester.
  - Mostly thanks to the King and Queen, and the high praises they had sung of me.
  - "But it wasn\u2019t the words alone from the royal duo that was enough."
  - The people who were there, and saw my performance with their own two eyes, also
    conversed with the kingdom.
  - And the kingdoms beyond this one.
  - Even the ones beyond them, too!
  - When the King and Queen allowed it, I became a travelling jester of sorts.
  - I was booked months in advance by other Kings and Queens, and many of the locals,
    who wished to see me perform.
  - There was this feeling like I had more meaning to my life now that I could put
    on a good performance for all to see.
  - And, instead of being cooped up in the same dingy kingdom, I could now travel
    the world!
  - "While it was sad that I couldn\u2019t see much of my family because of how much
    I worked now."
  - But knowing that they were safe, and living a comfortable life, was enough to
    keep me happy.
